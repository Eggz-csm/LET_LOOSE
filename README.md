  Working a simple job in a classified center, one day you will see the alarms blare, you will hear the screams as they burst your ears, and then, a lifeless silence. At that moment you will know that it has been let loose, at that moment, you will be set free. "LET LOOSE" is a metroidvania-shooter with horror game aspects, and engaging environments inspired by games like "Deadcells" and "CARRION". The game will feature multiple guns, enemies, and levels all having their place in the games story. The game has a (Probably) linear story and will also have a small infinite mode (Probably). All lore, weapons, level, and other aspects are subject to change over the course of developement.
